**This will be a reference outline of the current chapter. All Airway Questions should be expanded upon and explored deeper in seperate pages.**

Airway Management, Respiration, and Artificial Ventilation:

Integrates complex knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology into the assessment to develop and implement a treatment plan with the goal of ensuring a patent airway, adequate mechanical ventilation, and respiration for patients of all ages.



1. **Review the anatomy of the respiratory system, including the major structures of the upper and lower airway. (pp 959–961)**

Upper Airway:

`The Airway is composed of Upper and Lower airways. Being familiar with these wil anatomies will help us with skills such as ET Intubation.`

`The Tongue and Uvula are important structures that can be found in the oral cavity; The tongue being a very common obstruction and the uvula being a potential gag-reflex trigger.`

`The Pharynx is a muscular tube that extends through the Nose to the Mouth down to the esophagus and Trachea. It is composed of the NAsopharynx/Oropharynx/Laryngopharynx The Laryngopharynx opens into the Larynx and the Esophagus`

Lower Airway:

`The Lower airway extends from the flottis to the pulmonary capillary membrane. The Lower airway starts in the Larynx.`

`The Larynx is mostly a cartilage based structure that is composed of the: Hyoid bone/Thyrohyoid ligament/Laryngeal Prominence/Corniculate Cartilage/Thyroid Cartilage/Aryteroid Cartilage/Cricothyroid Membrane/Cricoid Cartilage/Trachea`

`Out of the many important structures here we mostly care about the Laryngeal Prominence (the Adams Apple), The Cricoid Cartilage/Cricoid Rings these form the lowest points of the larynx and is the only circumferential rings around the trachea, The Thyroid cartilage is a structure that lays directly below the Laryngeal Prominence and slightly above the Cricoid Cartilage..

`Adams apples are more prominent in males while Cricoid Cartilages are more prominent in females`

`The Space inbetween the Thyroid Cartilage and the Cricoid Cartilage is known as the Cricothyroid Membrane. It is here where an emergency surgical airway can be obtained via a Cricothyrotomy.

`The glottis is the narrowest portion of the adult airways. The vocal cords are also located in this structure as well. The glottis is covered by the Epiglottis, this is responsible for opening and closing the entrance to our trachea thus making its function vital for breathing.`

`When performing an ET Intubation it is important to recognize the importance of all of the structures in the glottis.`

`Just beyond the vocal cords is the Trachea, note that the trachea doesn't descend into a straight tube.`
