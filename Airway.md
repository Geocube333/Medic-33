**This will be a reference outline of the current chapter. All Airway Questions should be expanded upon and explored deeper in seperate pages.**

Airway Management, Respiration, and Artificial Ventilation:

Integrates complex knowledge of anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology into the assessment to develop and implement a treatment plan with the goal of ensuring a patent airway, adequate mechanical ventilation, and respiration for patients of all ages.



1. **Review the anatomy of the respiratory system, including the major structures of the upper and lower airway. (pp 959–961)**

Upper Airway:

`The Airway is composed of Upper and Lower airways. Being familiar with these wil anatomies will help us with skills such as ET Intubation.`

`The Tongue and Uvula are important structures that can be found in the oral cavity; The tongue being a very common obstruction and the uvula being a potential gag-reflex trigger.`

`The Pharynx is a muscular tube that extends through the Nose to the Mouth down to the esophagus and Trachea. It is composed of the NAsopharynx/Oropharynx/Laryngopharynx The Laryngopharynx opens into the Larynx and the Esophagus`

Lower Airway:

`The Lower airway extends from the flottis to the pulmonary capillary membrane. The Lower airway starts in the Larynx.`

`The Larynx is mostly a cartilage based structure that is composed of the: Hyoid bone/Thyrohyoid ligament/Laryngeal Prominence/Corniculate Cartilage/Thyroid Cartilage/Aryteroid Cartilage/Cricothyroid Membrane/Cricoid Cartilage/Trachea`

`Out of the many important structures here we mostly care about the Laryngeal Prominence (the Adams Apple), The Cricoid Cartilage/Cricoid Rings these form the lowest points of the larynx and is the only circumferential rings around the trachea, The Thyroid cartilage is a structure that lays directly below the Laryngeal Prominence and slightly above the Cricoid Cartilage..

`Adams apples are more prominent in males while Cricoid Cartilages are more prominent in females`

`The Space inbetween the Thyroid Cartilage and the Cricoid Cartilage is known as the Cricothyroid Membrane. It is here where an emergency surgical airway can be obtained via a Cricothyrotomy.

`The glottis is the narrowest portion of the adult airways. The vocal cords are also located in this structure as well. The glottis is covered by the Epiglottis, this is responsible for opening and closing the entrance to our trachea thus making its function vital for breathing.`

`When performing an ET Intubation it is important to recognize the importance of all of the structures in the glottis.`

`Just beyond the vocal cords is the Trachea, note that the trachea doesn't descend into a straight tube.`

`CO2 has a greater affinity for binding to Hemoglobin as opposed to Oxygen, thus hypercapnia will often restrict the amount of Oxygen that can be perfused to cells/tissues.`

`Conditions that reduce the surface area for gas exchange also decrease the body's oxygen supply. Examples of this would be: Pneumonia/Pulmonary Edema/COPD`

`Intrapulmonary Shunting: Bypassing of Oxygen-Poor blood past nonfunctional alveoli.`

2. **Discuss the physiology of breathing, including ventilation, oxygenation, and respiration. (p 961)**

`Ventilation: Physical act of moving air in and out of the lungs.`
`Oxygenation: The process of loading Oxygen molecules into hemoglobin molecules in the bloodstream.`
`Respiration: The exchange of CO2 and O2 in the alveoli and tissues of the body.`

`Respiration happens both internally and externally. External being in the lungs with our alveoli and Internally being within our capillaries with hemoglobin.`

3. **Describe factors related to the pathophysiology of respiration, including ventilation–perfusion ratio mismatch, hypoventilation, hyperventilation, and circulatory compromise. (pp 961–966)**                                     AND
4. **Describe factors related to ventilation, including partial pressure and volumes. (pp 963–964)**

`Hypoxia: When cells/tissues in the body do not get adequate Oxygenation.`
`signs and symptoms include: restlessness/irritabilty/apprehension/tachycardia/anxiety`
`later signs and symptoms: AMS/weak thready pulse/cyanosis`
`Most patients will report Shortness of breath, and are unable to speak fully.`
`Treat with Oxygen.`

`Ventilation-Perfusion Ratio and Mismatch: Air and blood must flow to the same places at the same time in order for simple diffusion to occur. A failure to match both ventilations and perfusion can result in abnormalities in O2 and CO2 exchanges.`
`Most people have a resting minute ventilation of 6L/min; Although 1/3rd of this volume is deadspace making for an alveolar volume of 4L/min. Now Pulmonary artery blood flow is approximately 5L/min, thus leaving us an overall ration of ventilations to perfusions to be 4:5L/min (simplified to a 0.8L/min)`
`When ventilations are compromised but perfusion is not, blood still passes alveoli but the blood doesn't always undergo respiration.`
`Alternatively When perfusion is compromised the alveoli are still filled with O2 HOWEVER blood cannot properly disperse it to the rest of the body.`

`Ventilation-Perfusion Ratio Mismatch (V/Q mismatch) can lead to hypoxia and will need immediate interventions.`

`Not all Ventilation problems are physical, some can be medical especially in cases where the CNS/PNS are compromised.`

`Examples of common Pathologies: CNS Depressants/Trauma/Muscular dystrophy/poliomyelitis/Polio/Allergic reactions/Angioedema/Bronchoconstriction/COPD/Asthma/Foreign Bodies/Chest Trauma/Airway Trauma/`

`In the event the level of CO2 exceeds the bodies ability to get rid of gas by ventilation, then the partial pressure of CO2 will rise resulting in hypoventilation.`

`Hypoventilation: Slow and/or Shallow breathing.`
`Hypoventilation can be caused by CO2 being produced faster than the body can eliminate it OR by the CO2 elimination being depressed to the exyent that it can no longer keep up with the normal metabolism.`

`Hyperventilation: Rapid and/or Deep breathing.`
`Hyperventilation can occur when the CO2 elimination EXCEEDS the CO2 production.`

`Both hypo and hyperventilation are usually conditions seen when the body compensates for various conditions.`

`decreases in minute volume can cause for a buildup of CO2 in the blood while increases in minute volume can cause for a lack of CO2 in the blood.`

`hypercapnia: increased co2 in blood.`
`hypocapnia: decreased co2 in blood.`

`Circulatory Compromises can happen primarily in traumas some of these conditions are: Simple+Tension Pneumothorax/Open pneumothorax/Hemothorax/Hemopneumothorax/Pulmonary Embolism/Heart Failure/Cardiac Tamponade/Hemorrhagic Shock/Vasodilatory Shock.`

5. **Discuss acid–base imbalance, specifically respiratory acidosis and respiratory alkalosis. (pp 965–966)**

`Anything that hinders respiratory function can lead to acid retention and acidosis. Acidosis quickly develops with respiratory distress or when apneic. Alkalosis can develop if the respiratory rate is too high. 

`There are four main acid-base disorders:`
`Respiratory Acidosis`
`Respiratory Alkalosis`
`Metabolic Acidosis`
`Metabolic Alkalosis`

`Fluctuations in pH due to the amount of Bicarbonate available in the body will lead to Metabolic Acidosis/Alkalosis.`

`Fluctuations in pH due to respiratory disorders that causes changes in how the body handles CO2 causes Respiratory Acidosis/Alkalosis.`

`Acid-Base disorders that are not immediately correctable by the bodies buffering systems cause the body to initiate compensatory responses to help return levels to normaly. Metabolic Acidosis can create respiratory alkalosis as a compensatory balance.`

`Pt. care often involves treating multiple Acid-Base imbalances.`

8. List the signs of inadequate breathing. (pp 967–969) %% 

`Pulsus Paradoxus: A clincial finding in which a BP can decrease by 10mmHg during inhalation.`
`Pt.s' presenting with Pulsus Paradoxus often have a decompensating COPD/Severe pericardial tamponade/Tension/pneumothorax/Severe asthma attack/Or other conditions that result in intrathoracic pressure`

9. **Describe the five abnormal breathing patterns to recognize when assessing a patient’s breathing. (p969)**

`Cheyne-Stokes Respirations: Gradually increasing rate and depth of respirations, followed by a gradual decrease of respirations with intermittent periods of apnea; associated with brainstem insult.`

`Kussmaul Respirations: Deep, rapid respirations; seen in pt.s with diabetic ketoacidosis`

`Biot (Ataxic) Respirations: Irregular pattern, rate, and depth of breathing with intermittent periods of apnea; results from increased intracranial pressure.`

`Apneustic Respirations: Prolonged, gasping inhalation, followed by extremely short, ineffective exhalation; associated with brainstem insult.`

`Agonal Gasps: Slow, Shallow, Irregular, or occasional gasping breaths; results from cerebral anoxia. Agonal gasps may be seen shortly after the heart has stopped but the brain continues to send signals to the muscles of respiration.`

`Central Neurogenic Hyperventilation: Tachypneic hyperpnea; rapid, deep respirations caused by increased intracranial pressure or direct brain injury; drives the carbon dioxide level down and the pH up, resulting in respiratory alkalosis.`


10. **Explain how to assess a patient’s breath sounds. (pp 969–972)**

`Breath sounds are to be auscultated at the apex, middle lobe, and base of each lung. It is also worth checking for Tracheal breath sounds by listening over the trachea or sternum.`

`Tracheal Sounds: Loud Inspiratory and Expiratory sounds`

`Bronchial Sounds: Inspiratory sounds that are shorter than expiratory sounds. Both are loud.`

`Vesicular Sounds: Soft, muffled sounds akin to wind blowing through trees. The expiratory ohase of vesicular sounds are barely audible.`

`Bronchovesicular Sounds: are a combination of the Bronchial and Vesicular breath sounds`

`note that Tracheal and Bronchial sounds are sometimes used interchangeably.`

`Duration plays an important part in breath sounds. A normal breath occurs with an inspiratory/expriatory ratio of 1:2, although when a pt.s lower airway is obstructed an expiratory phase can last longer; In cases of asthma an I/E can 1:5 or 1:4. Tachypneic pt.s can have a shorter expiratory phase that resembles more a 1:1 I/E.`

`Sounds that might be normal for one position may indicate an abnormal condition in another position. Tracheal sounds in vesicular areas can be a hint towards pneumonia.`

`Abnormal lung sounds include:`

`Wheezing: Continuous high-pitched sounds heard in both inspiration and expiration. Typically related to allergies.`

`Rhonchi: Continuous low-pitched sounds these indicate mucus/fluids in the larger lower airways. Think pulmonary edema or bronchitis.`

`Crackles: Audible crackles caused by the movement of mucus/fluid from large to smaller airways; usually clears up with coughing. It is also possible to hear these sounds with collpased airways or when alveoli pop open.`
`Crackles are often defined as being noncontinuous and usually appear in early/late inspirations. Early crackles happen when proximal bronchi open and is commonly seen with COPD pt.s, these tend to not clear up with coughing. Late crackles occur when peripheral alveoli pop open. These sounds are often heard in pt.s with reduced lung volumes. `

`Stridor: A loud high-pitch sound that typically occurs in the inspiration phase results from foreign body aspiration, infection, swelling, disease, or trauma within or immediately above the glottic opening. A pleural friction rub results from the inflammation that causes the pleurae to thicken, this causes a decrease in the pleural space causing the visceral and parietal pleurae to rub together; causing a stabbing pain with movement and breathing.`

11. **Explain how to assess for adequate and inadequate respiration, including the use of pulse oximetry. (pp972–974)**

`Pulse Ox is a cool tool that measures the amount of O2 in our blood although it does have many issues that can make it innacurate.`

`Peak Expiratory Flow: A device that can help determine the peak rate of a forceful exhalation, an increasing peak rate suggests that a pt. is responding well to meds. Most healthy adults will have a peak flow rate between 350-750mL. In order to test a pt. will blow all of the air in their lungs 3 times into a mouthpiece that will determine their output; repeat 3 times and take the best result.`

`Arterial Blood Gas analysis, although medics aren't typically trained to obtain an arterial blood specimen and we don't have the required equipment anyways; We do have non-invasive equipment that can help assess ventilation and oxygenation.`
