**This will be a reference outline of the current chapter. All Medication Administration Questions should be expanded upon and explored deeper in separate pages.**


1. **Describe the role of medical direction in medication administration. (p 798)**

`Medical Direction is required for certain medications to be administered. Med Control might also help supply you with information needed to administer certain medications. Medcon is useful for aiding in treatment.`

2. **Discuss the benefits of performing a Medication Administration Cross-Check (MACC) before administering a medication. (p 799)**

`A MACC check is to be done by 2 providers to ensure that their are no contraindications, the volume is correct, and that the medication is appropriately delivered.`

3. **Explain the importance of properly documenting medication administration. (p 798)**

`Important documentation can help rule out Medication errors, and in the case of medication erros being made; it can figure out how/who/where the error came from.

`Documentation is also important as a lot of controlled substances need to be properly accounted for.`

4. **Discuss paramedics’ responsibilities related to security of medications stocked on the ambulance. (p 799)**

`A medic is held responsible for the maintence of controlled drugs on their truck.`

5. **Explain the differences between aseptic, clean, and sterile techniques. (p 800)**

`Aseptic technique: A method of cleansing used to prevent contamination of a site before performing an invasive procedure.`

`Sterile technique: The destruction of all living organisms through heat/gas/chemicals.`

`Clean technique: Handwashing, use of gloves, keeping equipment clean as possible, and making sure a procedures site is as aseptic/sterile as possible.`

6. **Describe the use of standard precautions related to medication administration. (p 801)**

`Standard precautions exist in order to protect ourselves from possible biohazards. This includes ALWAYS assuming fluids to be infectious or properly disposing of sharps.`

`When followed properly standard precautions will lead to a healthier provider.`

7. **Discuss the signs and symptoms that can occur with changes in the body’s fluid status. (pp 801–803)**

`A pt.s change in body fluid can cause for either dehydration or overhydration.`

`Dehydration:`
`Symptoms: Decreased LOC/Postural hypotension/Tachypnea/dry mucous membranes/Decreased urine output/tachycardia/poor skin turgor/flushed dry skin.`
`Causes: Diarrhea/Vomiting/GI drainage/Infections/Metabolic disorders/Hemorrhage/Environmental emergencies/High-caffeine diet/Insufficient fluid intake.`

`Overhydration:`
`Symptoms: SOB/Puffy eyelids/Edema/Polyuria/Rales/Acute weight gain.`
`Causes: Unmonitored IV lines/Kidney failure/Severe kidney dysfunction/Water intoxication/Prolonged hypoventilation.`

8. **List commonly used intravenous (IV) fluid compositions and types of IV solutions. (pp 803–806)**

`Common IV compositions are Human Plasma/.45%, .9%, and 3% NaCl Solutions/LRS`
`IV compositions can be classified into Crystalloid solutions and Colloid Solutions.`

`Crystalloid Solutions: Dissolved crystals (i.e salts/sugars) in water`

`Colloid Solutions: Contain molecules (usually proteins) in water`

`Crystalloid Solutions usually have small crystals that are allowed to cross membranes and alter fluid levels. Colloid Solutions have large molecules that cannot cross membranes and sit in the vascular spaces.`

`Isotonic solution: Has the same concentration of sodium as a cell.`
`Hypertonic solutions: Have a greater concentration of sodium as a cell.`
`Hypotonic solutions: Have a lower concentration of sodium as a cell.`

`hypertonic solutions will cause fluids from the cells to transfer to the vascular spaces in order to maintain homeostatis, while hypotonic solutions will do the inverse.`

9. **Discuss the techniques for performing IV therapy. (pp 806–821)**
10. **Discuss the factors to consider when choosing an IV solution. (p 807)** x

15. **List the factors to check if the IV flow rate is incorrect. (p 821)**


`Choosing an IV solution is based on the needs of the pt. Pt.s in critical conditions are going to require different solutions than a pt. that needs meds or fluid replacement.`

`Prehospital settings are primarily concerned with two Isotonic solutions: N/S and LRS.`

`Choosing an administration set is important as that sets the speed at which your pt. will recieve meds. Too high of a rate and you can overdose your pt. while too low and you can underdose a pt.`

`Choosing an IV site comes with some complications. It is optimal to avoid valves/bifurcations as a catheter will struggle to pass through such areas.`
`Choose a vein that is straight/Springy/Avoids joints/Uninjured.`

`IV catheters primarily come in Over-the-needle catheters (some with automatic retractions) or Butterfly catheters that are primarily used in phlebotomy.`
`Outside of the device they all come in different gauge sizes.`

`Pediatric IVs might need smaller gauge catheters for smaller vasuclatures, may need additional gauze to stay secure, splints and boards may also be needed to secure our lines. Pediatrics might also get an IV in Scalp Veins or Umbilical Veins.`

`Geriatric IVs might also use smaller gauge sizings in order to keep the pt. comfortable along with reducing the risk for extravasation. Geriatric pt.s may need to have traction applied to skin due to an increased elasticity. Slower infusion rates should be given in order to reduce the chance of rupturing veins. Avoid smaller spider veins as they are least likely to tolerate a catheter.`

`When checking an IV flow rate for accuracy check:`
`IV fluid: make sure it is appropriate.`
`IV Administration set: Make sure the desired dose is met.`
`Height of bag: a bag lower than a pt. will end up drawing blood into the bag as opposed to fluid into the pt.`
`Catheter gauge: Making sure the correct gauge was used.`
`Constricting band: Make sure to apply/remove when necessary.`
`IV line positioning: Some lines may need manipulation in order to run properly.`

16. **Describe complications that can occur as a result of IV therapy. (pp 821–825)**

`IV complications are either systemic or localized.`
`Localized complications include: 

`Infiltration: The escape of fluid into surrounding tissue resulting in edema.`
`Extravasation is the unintentional escape/leakage of an irritating agent (a vesicant) from a vessel leading to blistering within the surrounding tissue.`
`Causes: Dislodement of catheter/Puncture of the vein wall during venipuncture/Leakage of solution/Poorly secured line/Poor vein/site selection/Irritating solution or medication that inflames the vein wall and causes it to weaken/Improper size/High delivery rate/High pressure supplied.`
`Signs+Symptoms: Sluggish+absent flow rate/Continued IV flow after the vein has been occluded above insertion site/Absence of backflow of blood/Pt. reports of tightness+burning+pain around IV site.`

`Catheter Occlusion: Physical blockage of a vein or catheter. If the flow rate becomes too slow then a clot may form and stop the flow entirely.`
`Signs+Symptoms: Decreasing drip rate/presence of blood in IV tubing`
`Causes: When an IV is placed in a positional site fluids will flow at different rates depending on the position of the catheter in the vein; such differences can produce occlusions. IV occlusion can also occur when a bag is nalmost empty and the pt.s BP overcomes the flow leading to fluid backup in the line.`
`Treatment: Do NOT flush a catheter to clear an occlusion, this can lead to an embolus. Remove the catheter and apply a dry sterile dressing to the site.`

`Venous Spasm: A severe reaction following the administration of irritating medications+fluids, can also be triggered by cold fluids and blood.`
`Substances with a high or low pH can irritate the vein, dextrose solutions with concentrations higher than 12.5%`
`Signs+Symptoms: Sluggish+Stopped infusion rate/Severe pain from the site/Blanching skin/Redness around the site.`
`Treatment: Slow the infusion rate until the spasm subsides. Remove entirely if the spasm persists.`

`Phlebitis: Vein inflammation.`
`Causes: Administration of irritating solutions+medications/Injury to the veins lining/Infection.`
`Signs+Symptoms: Pain/Tenderness along affected vein/Redness+swelling at site/Warmness in affected area.`
`Treatment: Discontinue the IV line and save the equipment for future analysis.`

`Thrombophlebitis: Vein inflammation caused by a thrombus.`
`Causes: Pt.s who misuse drugs/Longterm IV therapy/Vein-irritating solutions.`
`Signs+Symptoms: Slowed+Stop infusion rates/Aching+burning sensation at the infusion site/Warm+red skin at the site/Swelling of the extremety/Throbbing pain in the limb.`
`NOTE: these signs do not appear until after several hours IV therapy as its unlikely to see new onset thrombophlebitis in the field (outside of IFT pt.s)`
`Treatment: Stop the infusion and discontinue the IV from that site. A warm compress can help with relief.`

`Hematoma: Accumulation of blood in the tissues surrounding an IV site.`
`Causes: Bad cathetering insertion+removal techniques. Pt.s with pre-existing vascular diseases are also prone to hematomas/vein ruptures.`
`Signs+Symptoms: Bruising around IV site/Swelling+hardness at IV site/Inability to flush the IV line/Inability to advance the cannula completely into the vein during insertion.`
`Treatment: Stop IV advancement and apply direct pressure to minimize bleeding. If a hematoma develops after cannulation, evaluate the IV flow and the hematoma. In a controlled hematoma without a change in flow then monitor the site and leave the catheter in place. If a hematoma develops after removing an IV line then apply direct pressure with a gauze pad.`

`Nerve+Tendon+ligament Damage: Self-explanatory. 
`Causes: NTL damage can occur from improper venipuncture technique/Improper identification of structures/Improper stabilization of cannula/extravasation of solutions.`
`Signs+Symptoms: Sudden+Severe shooting pain/Tingling/Numbness/Loss of sensation/Loss of movement.`
`Treatment: Immediately remove and select a different IV site.`

`Arterial Puncture: It is possible to hit an artery instead of a vein.`
`Causes: Usually this will happen when going for an EJ IV.`
`Signs+Symptoms: Bright red blood spurting out of the catheter.`
`Treatment: Immediately stop the catheter. Hold pressure for 5 minutes or until bleeding stops.`

`Systemic Complications include:`

`Allergic reactions: Self-explanatory.`
`Causes: A pt. can be allergic to medications/IV solutions/Preservatives in solutions/Cannula material/Antiseptic preparation/Tape.`
`Signs+Symptoms: mild to severe allergy symptoms (i.e Chills/Fever/Hives/Itching/SOB/Wheezing)`

`Pyrogenic reactions: Pyrogens are foreign proteins capable of causing fever.`
`Causes: Some infusion solutions contain pyrogens that can induce a pyrogenic reaction. Usually faulty bags that have been compromised are likely to cause pyrogenic reactions.`
`Signs+Symptoms: Abrupt high temperature/Severe chills/Backache/Headache/Weakness/Nausea/Vomiting/Vascular collpase/Shock`
`Treatment: Stop lines immediately with any complaints of backache or a headache. Start a new IV line with a new IV solution. Treat for shock as needed.`
`NOTE: it takes roughly 30 minutes after an IV infusion to see signs+symptoms.`

`Circulatory Overload: Administering too much fluid leading to health issues such as pulmonary edema. Pt.s with Cardiac/Pulmonary/Renal dysfunction are at higher risk.
`Causes: Not readjusting the drip rate after flushing an IV line before insertion.`
`Signs+Symptoms: Anxiety/Dyspnea/Crackles/Cough/JVD/Bounding pulse/Hypertension.`
`Treatment: Slow IV rate/Use Semi-Fowler position to ease respiratory distress/Administer Oxygen if hypoxic/Monitor Vital signs+breathing/Use CPAP to push fluid out of lungs/Rapid transport.`

`Speed Shock: Rapidly introducing a medication to the circulation`
`Causes: Giving a medication at rate that is too high.`
`Signs+Symptoms: Dizziness/Anxiety/Pounding headache/Chills/Dyspnea/Tachycardia/Possible cardiac arrest.`
`Treatment: Stop the infusion but keep the IV line; Monitor vitals and provide supportive care.`

`Air Embolus: Air entering the bloodstream that acts as an embolus.`
`Causes: Air can enter during IV insertion/When tubing gets disconnected/When a solutions container runs out.`
`Signs+Symptoms: Sudden hypotension/Pallor/Cyanosis/Cool+clammy skin/Weak+thready+rapid pulse/Chest+shoulder+back pain/Diminished Level of Consciousness/Respiratory arrest.`
`Treatment: Position with the left side down/Administer Oxygem/Rapid transport/Possible ventilations.`
`NOTE: by positioning the pt.on their left side, the air embolus will get trapped in the right atrium/ventricle.`

`Vasovagal Reactions: A vasovagal syncope can occur with the body overreacting to a certain trigger like needles or blood.`
`Causes: Sight of blood or needles etc leading to a pt.s veins dilating causing a BP drop eventually resulting in fainting.`
`Signs+Symptoms: Sweaty palms/Feelings of warmness/Nausea/Dizziness/Light-headedness/Pale+diaphoretic/Fainting.`
`Treatment: Position Supine/Administer Oxygen/Monitor vitals/Supportive care/Transport`
`NOTE: Symptoms usually quickly subside when placed Supine.`

`Catheter Shear: When part of a catheter gets lodged into a pt.s bloodstream.`
`Causes: When a catheter gets pinched against a needle, causing the needle to slice the cannula leaving the pt. with a piece of cannula in their circulation.`
`Signs+Symptoms: Sudden severe pain/Reduced+absent blood return when checking catheter placement/Sudden Dyspnea/Hypotension/Tachycardia/Chest pain/Cyanosis/Loss of consciousness.`
`Treatment: Surgical removal is required. Place pt. in left lateral recumbent position with an elevated head position. Obtain an IV in opposite extremity and transport.`
`NOTE: if the Catheter shear happens but doesn't go far, a pt. may be asymptomatic.`

17. **Discuss transport considerations for a patient undergoing a blood transfusion. (p 827)**

`Medics need to verify the following: Pt.s name/Medical record number/Product being transfused/Unit number of the transfused product/ABO+RH type of product/Expiration date of the unit.`

`Some medics carry type O blood for emergency transfusions.`

`Any blood must be used within 4 hours, or returned to a blood bank.`

`Vitals must be obtained before infusion begins, in order to compare it with vitals that are grabbed during infusion to identify trends in pt.s vitals. Vitals must be assessed every 5 minutes. Closely monitor for Transfusion reactions. Saving the Blood bag and tubing for anaylsis by a blood bank.`

18. **Discuss the advantages, disadvantages, and techniques for establishing an intraosseous (IO) line. (pp 827–834)**
19. **List the types of IO devices available. (pp 829–831)**

`IO infusion is a technique in which fluids and medications are administered through the intraosseus space of the Proximal Tibia/Humeral Head/Sternum.`
`Primarily used for when an IV is inaccessible.`
`Establishing an IO line varies on location`

`Humeral IO Site: Placing the pt.s hand over their abdomen to force the humeral head to rotate. Placing the ulnar part of the hand laterally on the midline of the upper portion of the pt.s humerus. Placing your thumbs together palpate up the surgical neck to humeral head. It is important to use proper stabilization techniques and the appropriate needle selection for this to work.`

`Sternal IO Site: Palpate the sternal notch and apply IO access device.`

`Proximal Tibia IO Site: The flat bone of the Proximal Tibia is located medial to the Tibial Tuberosity (The bony protuberance right below the knee). It is necessary to feel the leg to differentiate between landmarks. Locate the Tibial Tuberosity, then palpate 0.8 inches medially for adult pt.s; for Pediatrics palpate 0.4-0.8 inches distally to avoid the epiphyseal plate.`

`Distal Tibia IO Site: Identify the medial malleolus, then palpate 0.8 inches to 1.2 inches above that site. In pediatrics palpate 0.4-0.8 inches above the medial malleolus.

`Different devices are used for IO access from manual drills, automatic drills, and spring loaded needles, there are also FAST devices for sternal use.`

20. **Discuss the potential complications of IO infusion. (pp 831-834)

`Complications of IO infusion:`
`When proper technique is used, then IO infusion has a relatively low complication rate. The same complications in IV infusions can be seen in IO infusions as well as a few extra.`

`Infiltration: When the IO needle is placed outside of the bone, causing for IV fluids to collect in soft tissues.`
`Causes: Improper technique/Bone fracture.`
`Signs+Symptoms: Infusion is not flowing properly/Rapid edema onset`
`Treatment: Discontinue the infusion immediately and reattempt insertion in the opposite leg. Undetected infiltration can cause compartment syndrome, which can lead to vascular compromise and even loss of the leg.`

`Osteomyelitis: Inflammation of the bone and muscle caused by an infection.

`Failure to identify the proper anatomic landmark can damage the growth plate, potentially resulting in long-term growth abnormalities in children.`

`Failure to use the appropriate IO needle size can result in fractures.`

`Through-and-through insertion occurs when the IO needle passes through both sides of the bone. To prevent this stop drilling after you hear a pop sound, as this means you're already in the bone.`
`Treatment: Remove the needle and try the other extremity.`

`Pulmonary Embolism: Its a pulmonary embolism.`
`Causes: IO insertion can sometimes cause pieces of bone/fat/marrow to enter the systemic circulation and lodge itself in a pulmonary artery.`
`Signs+Symptoms: Acute SOB/Pleuritic chest pain/Cyanosis.`

`Contraindications: include a Functional IV line availability/Fracture/Various bone degrading diseases/Bilateral knee replacements/Prosthetic limb at IO site.`
