**This will be a reference outline of the current chapter. All Medication Administration Questions should be expanded upon and explored deeper in separate pages.**


1. **Describe the role of medical direction in medication administration. (p 798)**

`Medical Direction is required for certain medications to be administered. Med Control might also help supply you with information needed to administer certain medications. Medcon is useful for aiding in treatment.`

1. **Discuss the benefits of performing a Medication Administration Cross-Check (MACC) before administering a medication. (p 799)**

`A MACC check is to be done by 2 providers to ensure that their are no contraindications, the volume is correct, and that the medication is appropriately delivered.`

2. **Explain the importance of properly documenting medication administration. (p 798)**

`Important documentation can help rule out Medication errors, and in the case of medication erros being made; it can figure out how/who/where the error came from.

`Documentation is also important as a lot of controlled substances need to be properly accounted for.`

3. **Discuss paramedics’ responsibilities related to security of medications stocked on the ambulance. (p 799)**

`A medic is held responsible for the maintence of controlled drugs on their truck.`

4. **Explain the differences between aseptic, clean, and sterile techniques. (p 800)**

`Aseptic technique: A method of cleansing used to prevent contamination of a site before performing an invasive procedure.`

`Sterile technique: The destruction of all living organisms through heat/gas/chemicals.`

`Clean technique: Handwashing, use of gloves, keeping equipment clean as possible, and making sure a procedures site is as aseptic/sterile as possible.`

5. **Describe the use of standard precautions related to medication administration. (p 801)**

`Standard precautions exist in order to protect ourselves from possible biohazards. This includes ALWAYS assuming fluids to be infectious or properly disposing of sharps.`

`When followed properly standard precautions will lead to a healthier provider.`

6. **Discuss the signs and symptoms that can occur with changes in the body’s fluid status. (pp 801–803)**

`A pt.s change in body fluid can cause for either dehydration or overhydration.`

`Dehydration:`
`Symptoms: Decreased LOC/Postural hypotension/Tachypnea/dry mucous membranes/Decreased urine output/tachycardia/poor skin turgor/flushed dry skin.`
`Causes: Diarrhea/Vomiting/GI drainage/Infections/Metabolic disorders/Hemorrhage/Environmental emergencies/High-caffeine diet/Insufficient fluid intake.`

`Overhydration:`
`Symptoms: SOB/Puffy eyelids/Edema/Polyuria/Rales/Acute weight gain.`
`Causes: Unmonitored IV lines/Kidney failure/Severe kidney dysfunction/Water intoxication/Prolonged hypoventilation.`

7. **List commonly used intravenous (IV) fluid compositions and types of IV solutions. (pp 803–806)**

`Common IV compositions are Human Plasma/.45%, .9%, and 3% NaCl Solutions/LRS`
`IV compositions can be classified into Crystalloid solutions and Colloid Solutions.`

`Crystalloid Solutions: Dissolved crystals (i.e salts/sugars) in water`

`Colloid Solutions: Contain molecules (usually proteins) in water`

`Crystalloid Solutions usually have small crystals that are allowed to cross membranes and alter fluid levels. Colloid Solutions have large molecules that cannot cross membranes and sit in the vascular spaces.`

`Isotonic solution: Has the same concentration of sodium as a cell.`
`Hypertonic solutions: Have a greater concentration of sodium as a cell.`
`Hypotonic solutions: Have a lower concentration of sodium as a cell.`

`hypertonic solutions will cause fluids from the cells to transfer to the vascular spaces in order to maintain homeostatis, while hypotonic solutions will do the inverse.`

8. **Discuss the techniques for performing IV therapy. (pp 806–821)**
9. **Discuss the factors to consider when choosing an IV solution. (p 807)** x
10. **Discuss the factors to consider when choosing an administration set. (pp 808–809)**x
11. **Discuss the factors to consider when choosing an IV site. (pp 809–812)**x
12. **List the types of IV catheters. (p 847)**
13. **Describe special considerations when performing IV therapy on a pediatric or older adult patient. (pp 820–821)**
14. **List the factors to check if the IV flow rate is incorrect. (p 821)**


`Choosing an IV solution is based on the needs of the pt. Pt.s in critical conditions are going to require different solutions than a pt. that needs meds or fluid replacement.`

`Prehospital settings are primarily concerned with two Isotonic solutions: N/S and LRS.`

`Choosing an administration set is important as that sets the speed at which your pt. will recieve meds. Too high of a rate and you can overdose your pt. while too low and you can underdose a pt.`

`Choosing an IV site comes with some complications. It is optimal to avoid valves/bifurcations as a catheter will struggle to pass through such areas.`
`Choose a vein that is straight/Springy/Avoids joints/Uninjured.`

`IV catheters primarily come in Over-the-needle catheters (some with automatic retractions) or Butterfly catheters that are primarily used in phlebotomy.`
`Outside of the device they all come in different gauge sizes.`

`Pediatric IVs might need smaller gauge catheters for smaller vasuclatures, may need additional gauze to stay secure, splints and boards may also be needed to secure our lines. Pediatrics might also get an IV in Scalp Veins or Umbilical Veins.`

`Geriatric IVs might also use smaller gauge sizings in order to keep the pt. comfortable along with reducing the risk for extravasation. Geriatric pt.s may need to have traction applied to skin due to an increased elasticity. Slower infusion rates should be given in order to reduce the chance of rupturing veins. Avoid smaller spider veins as they are least likely to tolerate a catheter.`

`When checking an IV flow rate for accuracy check:`
`IV fluid: make sure it is appropriate.`
`IV Administration set: Make sure the desired dose is met.`
`Height of bag: a bag lower than a pt. will end up drawing blood into the bag as opposed to fluid into the pt.`
`Catheter gauge: Making sure the correct gauge was used.`
`Constricting band: Make sure to apply/remove when necessary.`
`IV line positioning: Some lines may need manipulation in order to run properly.`
