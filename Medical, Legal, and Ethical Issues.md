1. **Differentiate between laws and ethics. (pp 118–119)**

  

Laws define our obligations and protect our rights and the rights of others. Ethics are principles, either personal or societal, that determine what is right and wrong

  

Ethics is the branch of philosophy that deals with the study and understanding of

the distinction between right and wrong and how people apply concepts of right and

wrong to their personal and professional lives

  

2. **Describe medical ethics, including the implications for paramedics. (pp 119–123)**

  

Personal ethics are the product of your upbringing, family and community influences, your religious background, and your conscience. On the other hand, professional ethics arise out of your profession’s standards and practices

  

As a paramedic, you must always be ethical in your practice and be aware of your

own moral standards in your daily work. The interests of your patient should take

precedence over your personal beliefs and standards

  

 It is a safe generalization to say that if you

place the patient’s welfare ahead of all other considerations, you will rarely (if ever)

commit an unethical act in the practice of emergency medical care.

  

(1) to do no harm, (2) to act in good faith, and (3) to always act in the patient’s

best interest.

  

As a paramedic, you must be accountable for your actions at all times. How you

handle teamwork, your personal attitude on the job, justice and respect for patient

autonomy, and cultural or lifestyle diversity will ultimately shape your career.

Consider what type of paramedic you want to become Figure 4-4. It is helpful for

you, as a new paramedic, to choose a mentor whose style and professionalism you

wish to emulate.

  
  
  
  
  

3. **Discuss the legal system in the United States and how it affects paramedics. (pp 123–124)**

  

In most cases, these court decisions establish negligence standards (discussed later in this chapter) that will apply if a patient sues you

  
  

4. **Differentiate between civil and criminal law relevant to paramedics. (pp 124–126)**

  

civil law, under which a patient can sue you for a perceived injury

criminal law, under which the state can prosecute you for breaking a legal statute

  

5. **Describe the process of a typical lawsuit against emergency medical services. (pp 126–127)**

  

A civil lawsuit begins when a dissatisfied patient contacts an attorney, who then files

a document for a lawsuit (called a complaint) on behalf of the patient with a local

court. The court where the action is first filed is generally referred to as the court of

original jurisdiction. In the context of EMS, the complaint will contain the general

allegations against you and the EMS system, but may not contain much specific

information about what the patient thinks went wrong. The patient’s attorney (or the

attorney’s staff) must hand-deliver a copy of the complaint and a notice called a

summons to all people or agencies named in the lawsuit, notifying them of the

complaint and the need to respond.

  

Your attorney will usually be assigned to you by the insurance company that

handles your employer’s claims, whether the employer is a government or private

agency. The response, or answer to the complaint, will be filed by your attorney.

After the complaint is filed and you (through your attorney) have answered, an

interval known as the discovery period begins. The discovery period can last

anywhere from a few months to more than 2 years Figure 4-8. During the discovery

period, attorneys on both sides seek to find out as much about the case as possible.

They will exchange written questions that the parties must answer under oath,

exchange documents such as the patient’s medical record, and take depositions

(statements recorded under oath). Stay in touch with your attorney during this time

and ask for a full explanation of everything that is happening. Your attorney will also

prepare you for a deposition, instructing you where to go, what to wear, and how to

respond to certain types of questions.

  

Attorneys may also file motions (requests for the court to take an action) and

argue them before the judge.

  

Most civil cases are resolved during a settlement process because it is expensive

and time-consuming to take a case through trial. Settlement processes bring the

parties and their attorneys together for mediation, which is a conference set up to

see if the parties can agree on a dollar amount that will resolve the case, or

arbitration, which is a mini-trial in which a single arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators

makes a decision based on the evidence presented by both sides.

If the case is not resolved during the settlement process, then it will proceed to

trial. During a trial, the judge rules on what the law is and the jury decides what the

facts are. Trial juries can be unpredictable; if they perceive that the EMS system has

failed to meet community standards, then large monetary damages can be

rewarded. In most cases, the trial will be the final step in the judicial process, but the

party that loses at trial always has the right to have the decision reviewed by an

appellate court

  

==============================================================

  

6. **Discuss the legal and ethical accountability of paramedics. (pp 127–128)**

  

Ultimately, you have three lines of authority to answer within the EMS system: your medical director, the licensing agency, and your employer.

  

Your actions as a paramedic, therefore, are not the physician’s actions, and you

will be held accountable for your own actions. However, the medical director can be

held legally accountable for failing to supervise you closely enough, or for failing to

take action if your performance is not up to standard.

  

Many of your activities as a paramedic require an order from a licensed physician.

Orders may be given by radio or mobile phone (online medical control), or they may

be defined by protocols or standing orders (off-line medical control). In any case, you

are not at liberty to disregard or reverse a physician’s order unless you truly believe

that carrying out the order will harm the patient

  

A physician is not required to ride to the ED with EMS personnel unless that

physician has performed procedures above the EMS providers’ level or has

otherwise assumed responsibility for patient care. Always be sure that the physician

is licensed in your state, and document the physician’s name and contact

information before allowing a physician to provide patient care.

  

Do not follow a physician’s order that falls outside of your scope of practice. Such action would fall under the borrowed servant doctrine, a principle that absolves your institution from liability when you act beyond your scope of certification or training by following someone else’s orders

  

7. **Discuss legislation that affects paramedic practice. (p 128)**

  

Administrative regulations set forth by bureaucracies at state and federal levels

affect and define the specific rules under which paramedics practice. For example,

regulations may set out the specific skills and medications to be used by each EMS

provider level

  

The terms licensure and certification are often confused because, in some states,

paramedics are considered licensed, but in others, they are considered certified.

  

If you commit an infraction of the rules pertaining to licensure, then the agency that

granted the license may seek to restrict, suspend, or even revoke your privilege to

practice.

  

8. **Differentiate between licensure and certification as they apply to paramedic practice. (pp 128–129)**

  

Certification generally refers to a certain level of credentials based on hours of

training and assessment exams, and addresses criteria that must be met for

minimum competency. Certification may be granted by a governmental agency or a

private organization (eg, American Heart Association, American Red Cross,

Emergency Care and Safety Institute, Health and Safety Institute, National Safety

Council). The fact that you have received certification from a private organization

does not necessarily mean that you have the authority to practice the skills included

in that certification.

  

Licensure refers to a carefully defined level of practice, usually granted by a

government agency or local authority such as a state health department or county

EMS authority. Often, these agencies themselves create and administer the

licensing exams. A license is a privilege granted by a government authority on

certain conditions. You must comply with the government’s requirements for

professional behavior, continuing education, and licensure renewal, or risk losing

that privilege. The rights and privileges conferred by licensing in one state may not

be conferred in other states that certify, rather than license, paramedics.

  

9. **Explain the importance and necessity of patient confidentiality and the standards for maintaining patient confidentiality applicable to paramedic practice. (pp 129–130)**

  

It protects a person’s protected health information (PHI), which is any identifiable health

information created, disclosed, used, maintained, stored, or transmitted that is

related to providing a health care service

  

Medical information can be disclosed only if it is necessary for a patient’s

treatment, for payment or medical billing purposes, or when the release has been

authorized in writing by the patient or a lawful patient representative

  

HIPAA was created not to stop the flow and continuity of a patient’s health care information, but rather to control the distribution of information to ensure the patient’s privacy.

  

You cannot casually discuss a patient in places where you might be

overheard, such as in an elevator or hospital cafeteria Figure 4-9. Use caution when

giving reports or discussing patient information in other public places such as crash

scenes or common areas in the ED. Sharing patient stories with other paramedics

may subject you to liability. Similarly, use caution when members of the media or the

public are riding with your service to ensure PHI is not disclosed without the patient’s

consent.

  

HIPAA requires you to provide patients with a copy of your service’s privacy

policies. Although this step can often be challenging to perform in an emergency

setting, you must do the best that you can to comply with the law. Most services

create multi page leaflets that can be handed out to patients for this purpose.

  

Confidentiality is also a part of the Code of Ethics for

Emergency Medical Technicians issued by NAEMT. If your service receives a

subpoena for a patient’s PHI, then be sure to notify legal counsel before releasing

the patient’s medical record to anyone.

  
  

10. **Discuss the legal and ethical issues surrounding patient transport. (p 133)**

  

in recent years, economic triage has been introduced. This term refers to the

practice of making health care decisions based on the ability of the patient or the

insurance carrier to provide payment for services.

  
  

As a paramedic, it is also vital that you clearly understand local protocols

regarding the choice of hospitals to which you may transfer patients. Only one

hospital may be available in some rural areas, but several options may be available

in other places.

  

EMTALA also regulates patient transfers and applies to both the sending and

receiving facilities. As a paramedic, you should never transfer a patient between

facilities who needs emergency medical care that falls outside your scope of

practice, and you must feel comfortable that the patient is stable enough to transfer.

  

Laws governing emergency vehicle operations do not authorize speeding, running red lights, or driving the vehicle in an unsafe manner if any of those activities puts the public at unreasonable risk.

  

Failure to transport a patient whose condition later deteriorates can bring about a lawsuit that is difficult to defend. Again, most EMS systems have protocols outlining when it is acceptable not to transport a patient, and many require consultation with online medical control.

  
  

11. **Describe the actions that you should take to preserve evidence at a crime or motor vehicle crash scene. (pp 133–134)**

  
  

 If the scene is a vehicle crash, then do not move anything unless doing so is

absolutely necessary to provide care

  

If the incident scene is indoors, then do not touch anything you do not have to

touch, such as telephones or doorknobs, because of the risk of eliminating

fingerprints. Carefully document any statements made by witnesses and get their

contact information. Limit the number of EMS personnel who enter the scene,

because each person who enters the scene further contaminates what may later turn

out to be a crime scene. If it is necessary to move furniture or other objects, then

notify law enforcement personnel that you have done so. Preserve any clothing that

you remove from the patient, and make every attempt not to alter evidence on the

clothing

  

In cases of sexual assault, the patient may carry vital pieces of evidence such as

fiber, hair, semen, or blood on the body. Take care to protect this evidence.

If the scene involves a death, then stay with the body until the police arrive.

Protect the scene from contamination by bystanders, family members, media, or

additional EMS personnel.

If you have any doubt about the possibility of saving the patient, then initiate

resuscitation and transport to the hospital.

  
  

12. **Explain the mandatory reporting requirements for special situations, including abuse or neglect, drug-related injuries, childbirth, suicide, and crime scenes. (p 134)**

  

Because reporting requirements vary widely from state to state, learn the laws of

your state and observe reporting obligations that apply to you.

  

13. **Differentiate between expressed, informed, implied, and involuntary consent. (pp 135–136)**

  

Informed consent is a patient’s voluntary agreement to be treated after being told

about the nature of the disease, risks and benefits of the proposed treatment,

alternative treatments, or the choice of no treatment at all. You must obtain informed

consent from every adult patient who has decision-making capacity.

  

 Expressed consent is a type of informed

consent that occurs when the patient does something, either by telling you or by

taking some sort of action, that demonstrates you have permission to provide

emergency medical care.

  

Implied consent is a form of consent assumed to be given by unconscious adults

or by adults who are too ill or injured to consent verbally to emergency life-saving

treatment. It also applies to minors if no parent or guardian is present.

  

involuntary consent to refer to situations in which a law enforcement officer or a legal guardian grants permission to treat someone who is under arrest (or otherwise in custody), incapacitated, a minor, or for other reasons.

  

14. **Describe the processes you should use to determine consent or valid refusal, especially relative to the patient’s decision-making capacity. (pp 136–137)**

  

Refusals, like consent, must be informed refusals, and all the same prerequisites

apply. Patients must have decision-making capacity to be able to refuse care.

Decision-making capacity is the ability of patients to understand the information you

provide to them, coupled with the ability to process that information and choose

medical care that is appropriate for them

  

If a conscious patient with decision-making capacity refuses to consent to

treatment, that person may not be treated without a court order

  

15. **Identify the steps to take if a patient refuses care, and when to transport a patient against the patient’s will. (pp 137–138)**

  

Be wary of situations when a patient refuses treatment and/or transport, but you

believe that treatment and/or transport is in the patient’s best interest. The patient

may be alert and oriented but incapable of making an informed decision even after

you communicate the need for care to the best of your ability. Examples of factors

that may prevent a patient from making an informed refusal include the following:

Head injury

Altered mental status

Unstable vital signs

Abnormal blood glucose levels

Abnormal oxygen saturation levels

Cerebral ischemia

Mental illness

Drug or alcohol intoxication

Urinary tract infection

Suicidal or homicidal ideation

Inability to cope with emotional distress

Developmental disability

  

If you reasonably suspect that a patient has an issue that impedes the ability to

give either informed consent or an informed refusal, then take aggressive steps in

the patient’s best interest. If you can contact medical control for direction, then

immediately inform medical control of your concerns, and the basis for those

concerns. Ask for guidance in transporting the patient without consent, and the best

way to accomplish this. If you do not have access to medical control, then it is

usually best to follow your instincts and transport the patient if forcible transport can

be accomplished reasonably and safely. Consider calling for assistance from your

EMS agency or law enforcement, and be keenly aware of your local protocols and

resources in this regard. Use whatever resources you have available.

  

In particular, psychiatric emergencies present challenges with respect to consent.

When a person’s life is not in danger, a police officer is generally the only person

given the authority to restrain and transport that person without consent.

  
  
  

16. **Identify methods for obtaining consent for minors, including exceptions for emancipated minors. (pp 138–139)**

  

Because minors have no legal status, they can neither refuse nor consent to emergency medical care. In the case of children and adults who have legal guardians, consent must be obtained, if possible, from a parent or legal guardian of the patient. If a parent or guardian is unavailable, then emergency treatment to sustain life may be undertaken without direct consent under the implied consent doctrine

  

 in loco parentis, a term that means “in the place of the parent.” This principle may also apply in school, day care, or summer camp if a parent is unavailable

  

A particularly difficult circumstance can arise if a parent or legal guardian refuses

to grant consent to treat a minor who clearly requires life-saving or limb-saving

treatment. Although adults have the right to refuse treatment for themselves, state

laws generally do not permit a parent or guardian to deny treatment to a minor. The

failure of a parent or guardian to allow such treatment may constitute neglect. If

confronted with such a circumstance, then notify law enforcement and medical

control. State law may permit the state to assume custody of the minor to ensure

that necessary emergency treatment is provided.

  

An emancipated minor is younger than the legal age (generally 18 years) in a

given state but can be treated as a legal adult because of qualifying circumstances.

Individual state law determines which circumstances qualify a minor as

emancipated, although most states recognize any minor who has been emancipated

by court order. Other states add criteria such as marriage, pregnancy, or active

military service. Emancipated minors may be treated as adults when obtaining

consent or refusal.

  

17. **Discuss the legal ramifications of patient restraint, both physical and chemical, for patient and practitioner safety. (pp 139–140)**

  

Under the law, you can use force only in response to a patient’s use of force against you. If you are attacked, then you may defend yourself against the attack. However, the use of temporary disabling sprays, knives, or firearms is generally outside the scope of paramedic practice and is usually prohibited by the EMS agency. The amount of force that you are allowed to use under the law is either equal to or slightly greater than the force offered by the patient, and must be in response to the patient’s actions. The use of extreme force in patient restraint is a common source of legal actions against EMS

  

18. **Define the four elements that must be present to prove negligence: duty, breach of duty, proximate cause, and damage (harm). (pp 140–143)**

  

The paramedic—or, in some cases, the EMS system—had a legal duty to the patient (duty to act). For example, a paramedic hired to serve a community has a legal duty to the citizens of that community.

A breach of duty occurred; that is, the person accused of negligence failed to act as another person with similar training would have acted under the same or similar circumstances. Breach of duty may involve doing less than the person was trained to do (an error of omission; ie, a paramedic who fails to splint an injured extremity) or doing more than the person was trained to do (an error of commission; ie, a paramedic who sutures a laceration when that skill is not within the scope of practice).

 The failure to act appropriately was the proximate cause (the first event in a chain of events) of the plaintiff’s injury.

Harm resulted.

  

19. **Discuss abandonment as it relates to paramedic practice. (pp 143–144)**

  

Abandonment is a form of negligence that involves the termination of medical care without the patient’s consent. This term also implies that the patient had a continuing need for medical treatment and that the abrupt termination of treatment was the cause of subsequent injury or death.

  

20. **Discuss patient rights, including autonomy, end-of-life decisions, and the moral and ethical implications of do not resuscitate orders and other advance directives. (pp 144–149)**

  

This right, known as patient autonomy, has come to the forefront of medical ethics. In almost every case, except where the patient is a minor or lacks decision-making capacity, you must respect and honor the patient’s right to make medical decisions, however irrational or unsound those decisions may appear.

  

the courts, including the US Supreme Court, have clearly recognized the right of patients to make decisions about their own medical care, even if that decision will bring about the patient’s death.

  

The EMS system, your medical director, the EMS agency for which you work, and your community’s standard of care may all compete with the patient’s wishes. These competing interests can create an ethical conflict

  

Never perform a procedure or administer a medication that you believe will be detrimental to the patient. For example, suppose a physician asks you to perform a procedure in which you are not trained or asks you to administer medication in a dose that is well outside the range of your protocols. In that case, it is essential to obtain clarification from the physician and communicate your objections.

  
  
  

21. **Identify situations in which it would be appropriate for you to cease resuscitation efforts or not to initiate resuscitation efforts in the field. (pp 148–149)**

  

An advance directive is usually a written document (but can also be an oral statement) that expresses the wants, needs, and desires of a patient about future medical care. Advance directives state what medical care the patient wants or does not want when the patient is unable to express these wishes. Living wills, do not resuscitate (DNR) orders, and organ donation orders are all types of advance directives.

  
  

22. **Discuss your responsibilities relative to resuscitation efforts for patients who are potential organ donors.** **(pp 149–150)**

  

In specific circumstances, a patient who is not successfully resuscitated may be a potential organ donor. Some medical centers can procure organs, including the kidneys and liver, in certain situations from such patients.

  

23. **Discuss common defenses to litigation, including contributory negligence. (p 150)**

  

statute of limitations and contributory negligence. Every state has laws that limit the time within which a lawsuit may be filed. Such laws are called statutes of limitations.

  

potential defense is known as contributory negligence. This defense will apply when the plaintiff has done something that contributes to injuries. For example, you encounter a patient with chest pain that appears to be cardiac in nature. Before administering nitroglycerin, you inquire about any recent use of erectile dysfunction medications. The patient denies using any such medication, even though he actually used one of the medications several hours earlier. Shortly after you administer the nitroglycerin, the patient experiences a severe drop in blood pressure and almost dies due to the interaction between the nitroglycerin and erectile dysfunction medication. In the lawsuit that follows, you are able to assert the defense of contributory negligence because the patient failed to state that he had used the medication several hours earlier, and that usage clearly contributed to his adverse reaction to the nitroglycerin.

  

24. **Describe forms of legal immunity that can apply to you as a paramedic. (pp 150–151)**

  

Good Samaritan law, not every state extends such protection to all citizens and off-duty EMS personnel. As a general rule, if you are on duty and have a legal duty to a patient, then the Good Samaritan law will not protect you. Good Samaritan laws may help cover you if you render assistance in another state, but they do not supersede the licensing agency’s laws in your state.

  

Paramedics working for government agencies, such as a fire department, also have some governmental immunity for their actions.

  

Governmental immunity does not cover civil rights violations, and attorneys can file lawsuits against paramedics in the public sector for violating a patient’s civil rights. The most common type of complaint occurs when EMS personnel either improperly restrain a violent patient or use excessive force to restrain a patient. Civil rights lawsuits may also be filed if your conduct as a paramedic deviates so far from the standard of care that a civil rights violation is said to occur.

  

paramedics work or volunteer for public agencies (eg, fire departments) and are sued by patients alleging civil rights violations, they may have another type of immunity called qualified immunity. Under this doctrine, you are held liable only when the plaintiff can show that you violated a clearly established law of which you should have known. This kind of immunity does not apply to tort cases.

  

25. **Discuss employment legislation regarding sexual harassment, discrimination, disabilities, the Family**

and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration law, and other

legislation that applies to paramedic practice. (pp 152–155)

  

The Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal law adopted in 1990 to protect qualified people with disabilities from being discriminated against in employment.

  

Title VII is the section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that prohibits discrimination in

  

employment based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. In addition, this section of the law provides protection against sexual harassment in the workplace.

  

The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 is a federal law that grants eligible employees the right to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year under certain circumstances. To be eligible for such leave, an employee must work for an employer with at least 50 employees and must have worked for that employer for at least 12 months. Leave may be taken to deal with a medical condition of the employee or a family member or a child’s birth or adoption

  

(OSHA) is the federal agency regulating safety in the workplace. States may enforce tighter regulations than those set by OSHA but may not make regulations more lenient. All employers are covered either by OSHA or an OSHA-approved safety plan.
