1. **Differentiate between laws and ethics. (pp 118–119)**

`Laws are our rights and the rights of others, one cannot impede on neither your own or a pt.s rights. Ethics are a set of principles each person operates on, although these shouldn't be walked over sometimes it may be necessary to do so.`
  
1. **Describe medical ethics, including the implications for paramedics. (pp 119–123)**

`Personal ethics are catered to each person and can be affected by your own life experiences, Medical ethics derive from a series professional practices and standards. `

2. **Discuss the legal system in the United States and how it affects paramedics. (pp 123–124)**

`The legal system is responsible for setting and applying negligence standards`

3. **Differentiate between civil and criminal law relevant to paramedics. (pp 124–126)**

  `Civil law is when a pt. sues for a perceived injury while criminal law prosecutes a practiononer for breaking legal statutes.`

4. **Describe the process of a typical lawsuit against emergency medical services. (pp 126–127)**

`A civil lawsuit begins with a pt. that contacts an attorney who files a complaint for a pt.`  

`An attorney will get assigned to an EMS agent through an insurance company usually the insurance company will be that of an employer, government agency, or a private agency. The practiononers attorney will then answer to the complaint filed against you; after this the discovery period begins in which both parties gather evidence.`  

`Most cases are resolved in the settlement process but in the even that a full trial takes place, the judge will decide what the law is while the jury decides on the facts. The trial is usually the last part of the judicial process but some cases can be appealed to higher courts.`


5. **Discuss the legal and ethical accountability of paramedics. (pp 127–128)**

`A paramedic will be held accountable for their own actions, however a Medical director can be held legally accountable for failing to supervise you closely enough or failure to ensure that your performance is not up to standard. A medic cannot follow an order that is outside of your practice.`  

6. **Discuss legislation that affects paramedic practice. (p 128)**

`Legislation provided by the government defines the scope of a medics practice, this extends to what procedures and medications we can give out.`  

The terms licensure and certification are often confused because, in some states,

paramedics are considered licensed, but in others, they are considered certified.

  

If you commit an infraction of the rules pertaining to licensure, then the agency that

granted the license may seek to restrict, suspend, or even revoke your privilege to

practice.

  

7. **Differentiate between licensure and certification as they apply to paramedic practice. (pp 128–129)**

`Certification generally refers to a credential based training that ensures a minimal level of competency. Certifications may be granted by a government agency or a private organization. Licensure refers to a defined level of practive that is usally granted by a government agency or local authority, a license is a privilege granted by the government; thus requiring you to maintain certain standards. Licensure cannot be transferred across states.`

8. **Explain the importance and necessity of patient confidentiality and the standards for maintaining patient confidentiality applicable to paramedic practice. (pp 129–130)**

`Pt. confidentiality protects the pt.s right to privacy. This makes it so a medic doesn't have to respond to press in regards to a pt., it also makes it so a medic cannot share stories about their pt.s as well.`

9. **Discuss the legal and ethical issues surrounding patient transport. (p 133)**

`A medic has to make sure to never take in a pt. for transport that needs Emergency medical care beyond their own scope of practice; a pt. must be stable to transfer. Emergency vehicles have their own set of laws that does not include driving recklessly. Failures in transporting pt.s whose conditions can deteriorate can bring about lawsuits that are hard to defend.`  

10. **Describe the actions that you should take to preserve evidence at a crime or motor vehicle crash scene. (pp 133–134)**

`Crime scene ettiquette is important, a medic should try to disturb a potential crime scene as little as possible, they are also required to carefully document statements made by witnesses. It is important to limit the amount of personnel at the scene and to also preserve any clothing that is removed from the pt.`  

`Certain cases can call for you to carry vital pieces of evidence such as hairs, fibers, or bodily fluids. In scenes that involve death it is important to stay with the body until police arrive. If there is any doubt about saving the pt. that is still our number one priority, even if it means leaving the scene.`

11. **Explain the mandatory reporting requirements for special situations, including abuse or neglect, drug-related injuries, childbirth, suicide, and crime scenes. (p 134)**

  
`There are many different reporting requirements from state to state. But in cases of abuse/neglect it is important to alert the appropriate authorities; Suicides and crime scenes will usually have you reporting to police.`

12. **Differentiate between expressed, informed, implied, and involuntary consent. (pp 135–136)**

`Expressed consent is when a pt. either takes an action or verbalizes that they agree to treatment. Informed consent is when a pt. agrees to a treatment option even after being education on the Nature of the disease and the risks/benefits of treatment. Implied consent is given when a pt. is unable to give consent themselves but would normally comply in a normal circumstance. Involuntary consent is when treatment is forced onto a pt. by a governing body that is not the pt.`

13. **Describe the processes you should use to determine consent or valid refusal, especially relative to the patient’s decision-making capacity. (pp 136–137)**

  

Refusals, like consent, must be informed refusals, and all the same prerequisites

apply. Patients must have decision-making capacity to be able to refuse care.

Decision-making capacity is the ability of patients to understand the information you

provide to them, coupled with the ability to process that information and choose

medical care that is appropriate for them

  

If a conscious patient with decision-making capacity refuses to consent to

treatment, that person may not be treated without a court order

  

14. **Identify the steps to take if a patient refuses care, and when to transport a patient against the patient’s will. (pp 137–138)**

  

Be wary of situations when a patient refuses treatment and/or transport, but you

believe that treatment and/or transport is in the patient’s best interest. The patient

may be alert and oriented but incapable of making an informed decision even after

you communicate the need for care to the best of your ability. Examples of factors

that may prevent a patient from making an informed refusal include the following:

Head injury

Altered mental status

Unstable vital signs

Abnormal blood glucose levels

Abnormal oxygen saturation levels

Cerebral ischemia

Mental illness

Drug or alcohol intoxication

Urinary tract infection

Suicidal or homicidal ideation

Inability to cope with emotional distress

Developmental disability

  

If you reasonably suspect that a patient has an issue that impedes the ability to

give either informed consent or an informed refusal, then take aggressive steps in

the patient’s best interest. If you can contact medical control for direction, then

immediately inform medical control of your concerns, and the basis for those

concerns. Ask for guidance in transporting the patient without consent, and the best

way to accomplish this. If you do not have access to medical control, then it is

usually best to follow your instincts and transport the patient if forcible transport can

be accomplished reasonably and safely. Consider calling for assistance from your

EMS agency or law enforcement, and be keenly aware of your local protocols and

resources in this regard. Use whatever resources you have available.

  

In particular, psychiatric emergencies present challenges with respect to consent.

When a person’s life is not in danger, a police officer is generally the only person

given the authority to restrain and transport that person without consent.

  
  
  

15. **Identify methods for obtaining consent for minors, including exceptions for emancipated minors. (pp 138–139)**

  

Because minors have no legal status, they can neither refuse nor consent to emergency medical care. In the case of children and adults who have legal guardians, consent must be obtained, if possible, from a parent or legal guardian of the patient. If a parent or guardian is unavailable, then emergency treatment to sustain life may be undertaken without direct consent under the implied consent doctrine

  

 in loco parentis, a term that means “in the place of the parent.” This principle may also apply in school, day care, or summer camp if a parent is unavailable

  

A particularly difficult circumstance can arise if a parent or legal guardian refuses

to grant consent to treat a minor who clearly requires life-saving or limb-saving

treatment. Although adults have the right to refuse treatment for themselves, state

laws generally do not permit a parent or guardian to deny treatment to a minor. The

failure of a parent or guardian to allow such treatment may constitute neglect. If

confronted with such a circumstance, then notify law enforcement and medical

control. State law may permit the state to assume custody of the minor to ensure

that necessary emergency treatment is provided.

  

An emancipated minor is younger than the legal age (generally 18 years) in a

given state but can be treated as a legal adult because of qualifying circumstances.

Individual state law determines which circumstances qualify a minor as

emancipated, although most states recognize any minor who has been emancipated

by court order. Other states add criteria such as marriage, pregnancy, or active

military service. Emancipated minors may be treated as adults when obtaining

consent or refusal.

  

16. **Discuss the legal ramifications of patient restraint, both physical and chemical, for patient and practitioner safety. (pp 139–140)**

  

Under the law, you can use force only in response to a patient’s use of force against you. If you are attacked, then you may defend yourself against the attack. However, the use of temporary disabling sprays, knives, or firearms is generally outside the scope of paramedic practice and is usually prohibited by the EMS agency. The amount of force that you are allowed to use under the law is either equal to or slightly greater than the force offered by the patient, and must be in response to the patient’s actions. The use of extreme force in patient restraint is a common source of legal actions against EMS

  

17. **Define the four elements that must be present to prove negligence: duty, breach of duty, proximate cause, and damage (harm). (pp 140–143)**

  

The paramedic—or, in some cases, the EMS system—had a legal duty to the patient (duty to act). For example, a paramedic hired to serve a community has a legal duty to the citizens of that community.

A breach of duty occurred; that is, the person accused of negligence failed to act as another person with similar training would have acted under the same or similar circumstances. Breach of duty may involve doing less than the person was trained to do (an error of omission; ie, a paramedic who fails to splint an injured extremity) or doing more than the person was trained to do (an error of commission; ie, a paramedic who sutures a laceration when that skill is not within the scope of practice).

 The failure to act appropriately was the proximate cause (the first event in a chain of events) of the plaintiff’s injury.

Harm resulted.

  

18. **Discuss abandonment as it relates to paramedic practice. (pp 143–144)**

  

Abandonment is a form of negligence that involves the termination of medical care without the patient’s consent. This term also implies that the patient had a continuing need for medical treatment and that the abrupt termination of treatment was the cause of subsequent injury or death.

  

19. **Discuss patient rights, including autonomy, end-of-life decisions, and the moral and ethical implications of do not resuscitate orders and other advance directives. (pp 144–149)**

  

This right, known as patient autonomy, has come to the forefront of medical ethics. In almost every case, except where the patient is a minor or lacks decision-making capacity, you must respect and honor the patient’s right to make medical decisions, however irrational or unsound those decisions may appear.

  

the courts, including the US Supreme Court, have clearly recognized the right of patients to make decisions about their own medical care, even if that decision will bring about the patient’s death.

  

The EMS system, your medical director, the EMS agency for which you work, and your community’s standard of care may all compete with the patient’s wishes. These competing interests can create an ethical conflict

  

Never perform a procedure or administer a medication that you believe will be detrimental to the patient. For example, suppose a physician asks you to perform a procedure in which you are not trained or asks you to administer medication in a dose that is well outside the range of your protocols. In that case, it is essential to obtain clarification from the physician and communicate your objections.

  
  
  

20. **Identify situations in which it would be appropriate for you to cease resuscitation efforts or not to initiate resuscitation efforts in the field. (pp 148–149)**

  

An advance directive is usually a written document (but can also be an oral statement) that expresses the wants, needs, and desires of a patient about future medical care. Advance directives state what medical care the patient wants or does not want when the patient is unable to express these wishes. Living wills, do not resuscitate (DNR) orders, and organ donation orders are all types of advance directives.

  
  

21. **Discuss your responsibilities relative to resuscitation efforts for patients who are potential organ donors.** **(pp 149–150)**

  

In specific circumstances, a patient who is not successfully resuscitated may be a potential organ donor. Some medical centers can procure organs, including the kidneys and liver, in certain situations from such patients.

  

22. **Discuss common defenses to litigation, including contributory negligence. (p 150)**

  

statute of limitations and contributory negligence. Every state has laws that limit the time within which a lawsuit may be filed. Such laws are called statutes of limitations.

  

potential defense is known as contributory negligence. This defense will apply when the plaintiff has done something that contributes to injuries. For example, you encounter a patient with chest pain that appears to be cardiac in nature. Before administering nitroglycerin, you inquire about any recent use of erectile dysfunction medications. The patient denies using any such medication, even though he actually used one of the medications several hours earlier. Shortly after you administer the nitroglycerin, the patient experiences a severe drop in blood pressure and almost dies due to the interaction between the nitroglycerin and erectile dysfunction medication. In the lawsuit that follows, you are able to assert the defense of contributory negligence because the patient failed to state that he had used the medication several hours earlier, and that usage clearly contributed to his adverse reaction to the nitroglycerin.

  

23. **Describe forms of legal immunity that can apply to you as a paramedic. (pp 150–151)**

  

Good Samaritan law, not every state extends such protection to all citizens and off-duty EMS personnel. As a general rule, if you are on duty and have a legal duty to a patient, then the Good Samaritan law will not protect you. Good Samaritan laws may help cover you if you render assistance in another state, but they do not supersede the licensing agency’s laws in your state.

  

Paramedics working for government agencies, such as a fire department, also have some governmental immunity for their actions.

  

Governmental immunity does not cover civil rights violations, and attorneys can file lawsuits against paramedics in the public sector for violating a patient’s civil rights. The most common type of complaint occurs when EMS personnel either improperly restrain a violent patient or use excessive force to restrain a patient. Civil rights lawsuits may also be filed if your conduct as a paramedic deviates so far from the standard of care that a civil rights violation is said to occur.

  

paramedics work or volunteer for public agencies (eg, fire departments) and are sued by patients alleging civil rights violations, they may have another type of immunity called qualified immunity. Under this doctrine, you are held liable only when the plaintiff can show that you violated a clearly established law of which you should have known. This kind of immunity does not apply to tort cases.

  

24. **Discuss employment legislation regarding sexual harassment, discrimination, disabilities, the Family**

and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), Occupational Safety and Health Administration law, and other

legislation that applies to paramedic practice. (pp 152–155)

  

The Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal law adopted in 1990 to protect qualified people with disabilities from being discriminated against in employment.

  

Title VII is the section of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that prohibits discrimination in

  

employment based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. In addition, this section of the law provides protection against sexual harassment in the workplace.

  

The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) of 1993 is a federal law that grants eligible employees the right to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year under certain circumstances. To be eligible for such leave, an employee must work for an employer with at least 50 employees and must have worked for that employer for at least 12 months. Leave may be taken to deal with a medical condition of the employee or a family member or a child’s birth or adoption

  

(OSHA) is the federal agency regulating safety in the workplace. States may enforce tighter regulations than those set by OSHA but may not make regulations more lenient. All employers are covered either by OSHA or an OSHA-approved safety plan.
