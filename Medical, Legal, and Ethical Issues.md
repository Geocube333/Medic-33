`A medic has to make sure to never take in a pt. for transport that needs Emergency medical care beyond their own scope of practice; a pt. must be stable to transfer.

It is important to limit the amount of personnel at the scene and to also preserve any clothing that is removed from the pt.`  

`Certain cases can call for you to carry vital pieces of evidence such as hairs, fibers, or bodily fluids. In scenes that involve death it is important to stay with the body until police arrive.
